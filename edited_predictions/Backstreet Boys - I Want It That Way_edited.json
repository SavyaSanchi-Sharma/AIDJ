She received her first dose of chemotherapy 18\u00a0days before admission with a new diagnosis of recurrent triple-negative breast carcinoma with brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The chemotherapy regimen was intrathecal methotrexate, oral capecitabine, and intravenous gemcitabine. The patient also received immunotherapy, intrathecal trastuzumab deruxtecan and nivolumab with daily dexamethasone.\n\nOn admission, the patient had stable blood pressure and heart rate, was afebrile, and had no respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation on room air was 94%. However, the patient was confused and lethargic. Neurological examination showed left hemiparesis and generalized hyperreflexia. The remaining examination was unremarkable.\n\nThe complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L (normal range 4\u201311\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L) with 49% neutrophils, 39% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, and 4% eosinophils. The absolute neutrophil count was 686/\u00b5L (normal range 1.8\u20137.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). Hemoglobin was 10.3\u00a0g/dL (normal range 12\u201316\u00a0g/dL). Platelet count was 215\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L (normal range 150\u2013450\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L). The comprehensive metabolic panel was normal, including liver and renal function tests. Serum lactate was within normal limits.\n\nThe patient had an MRI of the brain which showed a stable 8\u2009mm enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe. No new lesions or significant changes were identified.\n\nA lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed:\n- White blood cell count: 70\u00a0cells/\u00b5L (normal range 0\u20135\u00a0cells/\u00b5L)\n- Red blood cell count: 0\u00a0cells/\u00b5L (normal range 0\u20135\u00a0cells/\u00b5L)\n- Glucose: 39\u00a0mg/dL (normal range 40\u201370\u00a0mg/dL)\n- Protein: 133\u00a0mg/dL (normal range 15\u201345\u00a0mg/dL)\n- Gram stain: No organisms seen\n- Culture: Pending\n\nGiven the patient's neutropenia, lethargy, and elevated CSF white blood cell count and protein, infectious meningitis was suspected. The patient was started on empiric intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Dexamethasone was continued.\n\nDespite empiric antibiotics and antivirals, the patient's neurological status continued to decline. She developed worsening lethargy and began having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Repeat CSF analysis was performed 24\u00a0h later.\n\nRepeat CSF analysis showed:\n- White blood cell count: 120\u00a0cells/\u00b5L (increase from 70)\n- Red blood cell count: 0\u00a0cells/\u00b5L\n- Glucose: 28\u00a0mg/dL (decrease from 39)\n- Protein: 180\u00a0mg/dL (increase from 133)\n- Gram stain: No organisms seen\n- Cultures from the first and second lumbar punctures remained negative after 48\u00a0h.\n\nGiven the worsening neurological status, persistent CSF abnormalities despite empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, and negative cultures, chemotherapy-induced aseptic meningitis was highly suspected. The intrathecal methotrexate and trastuzumab deruxtecan were discontinued. The patient's dexamethasone dose was increased. Within 48\u00a0h of discontinuing intrathecal chemotherapy and increasing dexamethasone, the patient's mental status improved, and seizures ceased. A follow-up lumbar puncture 5\u00a0days after discontinuation of intrathecal chemotherapy showed significant improvement in CSF parameters (WBC 10\u00a0cells/\u00b5L, glucose 60\u00a0mg/dL, protein 50\u00a0mg/dL).\n\n**Question:** Based on the clinical scenario, what was the most likely cause of the patient's meningitis?\nA. Bacterial meningitis\nB. Viral meningitis\nC. Fungal meningitis\nD. Chemotherapy-induced aseptic meningitis\nE. Carcinomatous meningitis"
